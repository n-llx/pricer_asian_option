.SH REQUEST ARGUMENTS
.IP \fIconn\fP 1i
The XCB connection to X11.
.IP \fIwindow\fP 1i
The window to which to add the back buffer.
.IP \fIbuffer\fP 1i
The buffer id to associate with the back buffer.
.IP \fIswap_action\fP 1i
The swap action most likely to be used to present this back buffer. This is only a hint, and does not preclude the use of other swap actions.
.SH DESCRIPTION
Associates \fIbuffer\fP with the back buffer of \fIwindow\fP. Multiple ids may be associated with the back buffer, which is created by the first allocate call and destroyed by the last deallocate.
.SH RETURN VALUE
Returns an \fIxcb_void_cookie_t\fP. Errors (if any) have to be handled in the event loop.

If you want to handle errors directly with \fIxcb_request_check\fP instead, use \fIxcb_dbe_allocate_back_buffer_checked\fP. See \fBxcb-requests(3)\fP for details.
.SH ERRORS
This request does never generate any errors.
