The format string consists of
.IP
\- plain text,
\- directives, that start with '%',
\- escape sequences, that start with a backslash.
.PP
A directive that consumes an argument
.IP
\- starts with '%' or '%m$' where m is a positive integer,
\- is optionally followed by any of the characters '#', '0', '\-', ' ', '+',
.IP
each of which acts as a flag,
.IP
\- is optionally followed by a width specification (a nonnegative integer),
\- is optionally followed by '.' and a precision specification (an optional
.IP
nonnegative integer),
.IP
\- is finished by a specifier
.IP
\- 'c', that prints a character,
\- 's', that prints a string,
\- 'i', 'd', that print an integer,
\- 'u', 'o', 'x', 'X', that print an unsigned (nonnegative) integer,
\- 'e', 'E', that print a floating\-point number in scientific notation,
\- 'f', 'F', that print a floating\-point number without an exponent,
\- 'g', 'G', that print a floating\-point number in general notation,
\- 'a', 'A', that print a floating\-point number in hexadecimal notation.
.PP
Additionally there is the directive '%%', that prints a single '%'.

all directives that consume an argument must do so.
