# pricer_asian_option
C++ open-source project engine that prices path-dependent Asian options using Monte Carlo simulations. It models underlying asset paths via Geometric Brownian Motion to calculate arithmetic or geometric averages, delivering efficient derivative valuation through modern OOP principles and high-performance stochastic modeling.

Instructions:
- first execute the "setup.bat" that installs the necessary C++ dependencies for plotting (gunplot,...)
- second execute the "pricer.exe" already compiled program that works everything.
