.HP

.SH REQUEST ARGUMENTS
.IP \fIconn\fP 1i
The XCB connection to X11.
.IP \fIwindow\fP 1i
The root of the hierarchy to redirect to off-screen storage.
.IP \fIupdate\fP 1i
Whether contents are automatically mirrored to the parent window.  If one client
	already specifies an update type of Manual, any attempt by another to specify a
	mode of Manual so will result in an Access error.
.SH DESCRIPTION
The hierarchy starting at 'window' is directed to off-screen
	storage.  When all clients enabling redirection terminate,
	the redirection will automatically be disabled.

	The root window may not be redirected. Doing so results in a Match
	error.
.SH RETURN VALUE
Returns an \fIxcb_void_cookie_t\fP. Errors (if any) have to be handled in the event loop.

If you want to handle errors directly with \fIxcb_request_check\fP instead, use \fIxcb_composite_redirect_window_checked\fP. See \fBxcb-requests(3)\fP for details.
.SH ERRORS
This request does never generate any errors.
