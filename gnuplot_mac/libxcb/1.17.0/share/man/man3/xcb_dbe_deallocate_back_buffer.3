.SS Request function

.SH REQUEST ARGUMENTS
.IP \fIconn\fP 1i
The XCB connection to X11.
.IP \fIbuffer\fP 1i
The back buffer to deallocate.
.SH DESCRIPTION
Deallocates the given \fIbuffer\fP. If \fIbuffer\fP is an invalid id, a \fIBadBuffer\fP error is returned. Because a window may have allocated multiple back buffer ids, the back buffer itself is not deleted until all these ids are deallocated by this call.
.SH RETURN VALUE
Returns an \fIxcb_void_cookie_t\fP. Errors (if any) have to be handled in the event loop.

If you want to handle errors directly with \fIxcb_request_check\fP instead, use \fIxcb_dbe_deallocate_back_buffer_checked\fP. See \fBxcb-requests(3)\fP for details.
.SH ERRORS
This request does never generate any errors.
