# pricer_asian_option
C++ open-source portable project that prices path-dependent Asian options using Monte Carlo simulations. It models underlying asset paths via Geometric Brownian Motion to calculate arithmetic or geometric averages, delivering efficient derivative valuation through modern OOP principles and high-performance stochastic modeling.

Instructions:
- on Windows, execute setup_project.bat which will compile the project with the included compiler (mingw64), create the pricer.exe app and run it automatically.
